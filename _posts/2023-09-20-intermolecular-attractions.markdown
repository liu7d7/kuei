## Vocab
- Intermolecular attractions: attractive forces between molecules that are weaker than ionic or covalent bonds.
- Nonpolar molecules: a molecule without lone pairs.

## Van der Waals Forces
- a.k.a dispersion forces and dipole interactions
- These are the weakest molecular interactions, and is caused when electron motion in a molecule causes an
  uneven distribution of charges.
    - This happens even in nonpolar molecules.
- As the electron cloud in a molecule becomes larger, the dispersion forces become stronger, because the cloud
  becomes easier to polarize.
    - Here, polarization means to cause temporary oppositely charged ends.
- These happen even in nonpolar molecules because the sharing of electrons means that electrons travel between
  the two atoms, charging them temporarily.

## Class Notes
- Flash news: Heating plastic to high temperatures can create a sustainable and clean energy source called
  high-energy graphene and hydrogen. The continuation of this research can allow for more sustainable living.
- Submit soldering proposal to Kuei by 9/21 at 9pm.
- Lab prep:
    - Reading meniscus: read it at the bottom. Remember measuring: Marks + 1 estimated sigfig.
        - The meniscus is created by intermolecular forces clinging to the sides of the graduated cylinder.
    - Use crucible tongs 
    - Set up ring stand: put crucible on ring, then put watch glass on crucible, making sure to balance the
      watch glass first.
    - How to handle the nichrome wire: stop putting the cap on at the stopper.
- Corrections: p181, p207 chlorine -> fluorine
- We've learned about intramolecular forces earlier, but now we're going to learn about intermolecular forces.
- Dipole: separation of equal but opposite charges by small distance. 
- London Dispersion: temporary force, all electrons swarm into one place and then _disperse_.
- Only nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine will form hydrogen bonds because they have such a strong electronegativity
  that they can pull the valence electrons. This is a much more permanent bond, and that's why it has such a
  high force. Though chlorine has a high electronegativity, it's too large, so it doesn't have command over the
  electrons trying to attract.
    - ex. water has higher boiling point because it takes more energy to break that bond.
- Look at room temperature state: gas vs liquid: liquid has stronger bond.
- TODO: look deeper into the four types.

### Table of Intermolecular Forces

| Force | Strength | Characteristics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ion-dipole | 10 to 50 kJ/mole | ion-polar |
| dipole-dipole | 3 to 4 kJ/mole | polar |
| London Dispersion | 1 to 10 kJ/mole | all molecules size, polarity |
| Hydrogen bond | 10 to 40 kJ/mole | nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine |
