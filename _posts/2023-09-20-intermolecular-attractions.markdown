## Vocab
- Intermolecular attractions: attractive forces between molecules that are weaker than ionic or covalent bonds.
- Nonpolar molecules: a molecule with evenly distributed electrons that symmetrically cancel each other out.
- Dipole: a molecule with two equally but oppositely charged ends (poles), hence _di_-_pole_.
    - Temporary dipole: formed when a shared valence electron moves towards one atom making up the molecule,
      giving that atom a slight negative charge and the other a slight positive charge temporarily.
- Bulk properties: melting point, boiling point, volatility

## Van der Waals Forces
- a.k.a dispersion forces and dipole interactions

### Dispersion Forces
_outlined as London Dispersion in the table below_
- These can be the weakest molecular interactions, and is caused when electron motion in a molecule causes an
  uneven distribution of charges.
    - This happens even in nonpolar molecules.
- As the electron cloud in a molecule becomes larger, the dispersion forces become stronger, because the cloud
  becomes easier to polarize.
    - Here, polarization means to cause temporary oppositely charged ends.
- These happen even in nonpolar molecules because the sharing of electrons means that electrons travel between
  the two atoms, charging them temporarily.

### Dipole Interactions
_outlined as dipole-dipole in the table below_
- These are electrostatic attractions between the oppositely charged regions of polar molecules, because of the
  attractive force between the partially positive end of one dipole and the partially negative end of an 
  adjacent dipole.
    - ex. Iodine monochloride (ICl) is a polar molecule because 

## Hydrogen Bonds
- Hydrogen bonds occur when a hydrogen atom gets covalently bonded to a very electronegative atom such as 
  oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine. This only happens between hydrogen and the three elements listed previously
  because hydrogen doesn't have other electrons to shield its valence electrons from the nucleus.
    - The highly electronegative atom (the oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine) hogs the valence electron for most of
      the time it's being shared, so the N/O/F is partially negatively charged, and the hydrogen atoms are
      partially positively charged.
- Sometimes, a hydrogen atom gets bonded, but it's _not a hydrogen bond_ because it doesn't deal with one of the
  three (nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine, remember NOF)

## Properties of Molecular Substances
- Volatility: a measure of how easily a liquid evaporates. The stronger the intermolecular forces, the lower the
  volatility, because the molecules are held together stronger, which prevents the phase change into gas from
  happening.
- Melting Point: Molecular substances usually have lower melting/boiling points than ionic compounds/metals
  due to the weaker forces between molecules. The temperature at which the substances melt/boil depends on the
  strength of the intermolecular forces.

## Class Notes
- Flash news: Heating plastic to high temperatures can create a sustainable and clean energy source called
  high-energy graphene and hydrogen. The continuation of this research can allow for more sustainable living.
- Submit soldering proposal to Kuei by 9/21 at 9pm.
- Lab prep:
    - Reading meniscus: read it at the bottom. Remember measuring: Marks + 1 estimated sigfig.
        - The meniscus is created by intermolecular forces clinging to the sides of the graduated cylinder.
    - Use crucible tongs 
    - Set up ring stand: put crucible on ring, then put watch glass on crucible, making sure to balance the
      watch glass first.
    - How to handle the nichrome wire: stop putting the cap on at the stopper.
- Corrections: p181, p207 chlorine -> fluorine
- We've learned about intramolecular forces earlier, but now we're going to learn about intermolecular forces.
- Dipole: separation of equal but opposite charges by small distance. 
- London Dispersion: temporary force, all electrons swarm into one place and then _disperse_.
- Only nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine will form hydrogen bonds because they have such a strong electronegativity
  that they can pull the valence electrons. This is a much more permanent bond, and that's why it has such a
  high force. Though chlorine has a high electronegativity, it's too large, so it doesn't have command over the
  electrons trying to attract.
    - ex. water has higher boiling point because it takes more energy to break that bond.
- Look at room temperature state: gas vs liquid: liquid has stronger bond.
- TODO: look deeper into the four types.
