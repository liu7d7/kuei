## Result and Conclusions
1. Why do you think this investigation is titled "Mendeleev Lab?"
    - This investigation is titled “Mendeleev Lab” because we are grouping 
      elements together by similar chemical properties and observations when in
      chemical reactions, just like Dimitri Mendeleev did when he was creating 
      his periodic table.
2. Group the elements together and provide your reasoning for the groupings.
    - <i>see data table below</i>
    - Group 1: white particulates w/ A, no particulates w/ B, clear color w/ C,
      did not dissolve D
    - Group 2: no particulates w/ A, white particulates w/ B, clear color w/ C,
      did dissolve D
    - Group 3: pink particulates w/ A, no particulates w/ B, purple color w/ C,
      did dissolve D
    - Group 4: only that showed yellow particulates w/ A, no particulates w/ B,
      white color w/ C, did dissolve D

3.  Why aren’t there any members of today’s group 8A/18 on Mendeleev’s periodic
    table?
	- One possible explanation for this is that the elements in group 8A are 
      noble gasses, which are relatively non-reactive. Because Mendeleev relied
      on observations from chemical reactions to group the elements on his 
      periodic table, it’s possible these unreactive elements were grouped into
      one or left out because they did not react with any other known elements.

4. Why did we use 36 wells instead of 27 wells for the lab?
    - We used 36 wells because we had four test solutions and nine unknown 
      solutions, which produces 36 pairings of test solutions to unknown 
      solutions. We had to test each pairing in order to see all possible 
      reactions produced when the solutions were mixed together.
