- Cation: ion w/ positive charge, happens to elements on the left hand side.

- Mole (mol): an amount of matter equal to the atomic mass in grams.
- Atomic Radius: half the distance between nuclei of the same element, increases
                 towards the bottom left.
- Metallic Character: the tendency to lose an electron, increases diagonally up
                      and to the right.

                     to itself in a chemical bond, increases up and to the right.

## Reading Notes

### Patterns In Groups
- As you go down a group, Z<sub>eff</sub> decreases, meaning it takes less
  energy to remove the outermost electron.

### Patterns In Periods
- As you go across a period, Z<sub>eff</sub> 

### Atomic Radii
- According to the principle of effective nuclear charge, periodic
  properties of elements are directly related to effective nuclear charge
  experienced by their valence electrons.
- Atomic Radius is half the distance between the nuclei of two atoms of 
  the same element, and is used to estimate the size of an atom. It is
  usually measured in picometers, or 10<sup>-12</sup> m. Atomic radius
  increases from top (shortest) to bottom (longest) within a group.
- As more protons are added across a period, Z<sub>eff</sub> increases.
  A larger Z<sub>eff</sub> results in a larger charge, leading to a
  larger repulsive force between them, leading to a longer atomic radius. 
- Down a group, as more electrons occupy higher energy levels, atomic
  radius increases because those higher energy levels extend further
  away from the nucleus.

### Ion Size
- An ion is an atom/group of atoms that has a + or - charge.
- An ion that has lost an electon and therefore has a + charge is called a
  cation (mneumonic: _cat_-ion has a _paws_-itive charge). Cations have a
  shorter atomic radius because they have an empty valence shell due to the
  removed electrons.
- An ion that has gained an electron and therefore has a - charge is called
  an anion (mneumonic: _an_-ions have _a n_-egative charge). Anions have a
  larger atomic radius because they are shielded more, decreasing the 
  attractive force between the nucleus and the electrons, so they can move
  farther away from the nucleus.
- When a metal atom, such as sodium, loses an electron, it becomes a sodium
  ion, which has a 1+ charge. (-1e<sup>-</sup> means more positive charge.

### Ionization Energy
- Ionization energy, measured in joules is the energy required to remove the
  outermost electron from the ground state of a gaseous atom.
    - ex: 496 kJ/mol of energy is required to remove the outermost electrons
      from each atom of 1 mole of sodium vapor.
- The ionization energy of an atom is directly affected by its size, because
  its outermost electon will be closer to the nucleus, which means the force
  of attraction given by Coulomb's law will be stronger.
- Ionization energy decreases from top (most) to bottom (least) in a group 
  and generally increases from left (least) to right (most) in a period.

### Successsive Ionization Energies
- \>1 electron can be removed from an atom to form an ion. 
- The energy needed to remove the outermost n electrons is denoted I
  <sub>n</sub>.
- Metals have a low Z<sub>eff</sub>, lose electrons when forming ions, and
  have relatively low I<sub>1</sub>, whereas nonmetals have a higher
  effective charge, gain electrons when forming ions, and have a higher I
  <sub>1</sub> because of that.

### Electron Affinity
- When an atom gains an electron, an energy change happens called electron
  affinity.
- Most atoms release energy when an electron is added, and an atom w/ a higher
  electron affinity will release more energy.
- Higher means more negative in this case.
- Atoms in groups 16 and 17 have high Z<sub>eff</sub> so they have high electron  affinities.
- Electron affinity is not as regular a pattern in the periodic table as the
  other values.

### Common Charges in Representative Elements
- Elements in a group tend to form ions with the same charge, especially in
  groups 1, 2, 15, 16, and 17. 
- Metals in groups 1 and 2 tend to form cations, because metals lose electrons
  due to their relatively low ionization energies. 
    - The tendency of an element to lose electrons and form cations is called
      metallic character.
- Nonmetal elements in groups 15, 16, 17 tend to form anions, because they tend
  to gain electrons due to high electron affinities.
    - The tendency of an element to gain electrons is called nonmetallic
      character.

### Electronegativity
- Atoms pull on shared electrons in bonds, and usually one atom has a greater
  pull on the electrons.
- Electronegativity is the ability of an atom of an element to attract electrons
  towards itself in a chemical bond.
    - Fluoride is the most electronegative element, meaning it always pulls
      electrons towards itself when in a bond.

- Microbiomes in the gut are linked to diabetes, but this new study has linked a
  specific strain of bacteria that increases the body's response to insulin,
  meaning we can give probiotics to potential pre-diabetics.

- Negative in chem means "amount lost."
    - ex. -5g = lost five grams
