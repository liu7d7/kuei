Absorb heat: melt, vaporize
Release heat: condense, freeze
Specific heat of substance (s): amt of heat absorbed when the temperature of the substance is raised 1&deg;C.
Heat capacity (C) amt of heat (q) required to raise the temperature of a given qty (m) of a substance of the substance by one degree.
C = ms. 
Unit for Specific heat: J/g\*&deg;C
Heat absorbed/released: 
q = ms&Delta;t
q = C&Delta;t
&Delta;t = t<sub>final</sub> - t<sub>initial</sub>

How much heat given off when 869 g iron bar cools from 94 C to 5 C?
s of Fe = 0.444 J/g\*C
&Delta;t = t<sub>final</sub> - tinitial = -89 C
q = ms&Delta;t = -89 C * 869 g \* 0.444 J/g\*C = -34000 J

Sometimes you’re asked what the specific heat of a substance is given some other values

1 calorie is 4.184 joules

When IMFs are weak, volatility is high, boiling point low, vapor pressure is 
When IMFs are strong, opposite.



## Problems
How many calories does it take to raise 105mL of ice from -7.00&deg;C to 112&deg;C?

You have to split up steps by state because different states have different specific heats

- Solution is a homogenous mixture of 2+ substances.
- (Non)Electrolyte: substance that conducts electricity (or not) when dissolved in water.
- Free moving anions/cations conduct the electricity.
- Strong electrolyte: 100% dissociation (everything becomes an ion)
- Weak electrolyte: not completely dissociated (some parts keep their bonds?)
- j'ai aucune idée
- ionization of acetic acid is a reversible reaction.
- CH<sub>3</sub>COOH <-> CH<sub>3</sub>COO<sup>-</sup> (aq) + H<sup>+</sup> (aq)
- its ionization in water is incomplete, so it is a weak electrolyte.
- Hydration: a process where ions are surrounded by water molecs in a specific manner.
- Strong acids/bases are strong electrolytes. 
- Pure water is an extremely weak electrolyte
- Precipitation reactions
    - Precipitate: insoluble solid that separates from solution
- Ions that aren't part of the reaction are called spectator ions.
- Big Dad: 
- Big Mom: 
- Writing net ionic equations
    1. Write balanced molecular equation
    2. Write the ionic equation showing the strong electrolytes 
    3. ...
- Acids have a sour taste.
- what am I doing
- Acids react with certain metals to produce hydrogen gas
- 45 minutes left
- Straw blow into water: bubbles come out. Why? Air does not dissolve into water fast enough to have it all dissolve before escaping. 
- Bases ahve a bitter taste, feel slippery, cause color changes in plant dyes, and aqueous base solutions conduct electricity.
- Bronsted acid is a proton donor
- Bronsted base is a proton acceptor

- A bronsted acid must contain at least 1 ionizable proton!

- (Mono|di|tri)protic acids: donates only (1|2|3) proton
- HI (aq) -> H+ (aq) + Br- (aq) -> bronsted acid
- neutralisation reaction:
    - Acid + base = salt + water
    - HCl (aq) + NaOH (aq) -> NaCl (aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O
- Oxidation reduction reactions
    - 2Mg (s) + O<sub>2</sub> (g) -> 2MgO (s)
    - LEO GER -> Lost electron oxidation, gain electron reduction
- Zn (s) + CuSO<sub>4</sub> (aq) -> ZnSO<sub>4</sub> (aq) + Cu (s)
- Oxidation number: the charge an atom would have in a molec or an ionic compound if electrons were completely transferred. 
- Free elements (uncombined state) have an oxidization number of 0.
- In monatomic ions, the oxidation number is eq to the charge of the ion.
- The oxidation number of oxygen is usually -2. In Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> it is -1.
- The oxidation number # is -1 for hydrogen most of the time (H has low electronegativity), except when bonded w/ metals in binary compounds, where it's -1. 
- Group 1A metals are +1, 2A metals are +2, fluorine always -1.
- Zinc, Cadmium, Silver only have 1 oxidation number.
- Oxidation numbers of all the elements in the following? 
    - IF<sub>7</sub>
        - F = -1 (7&times;-1) + ? = 0 -> ? = +7, I = +7
    - K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
        - K = +1, O = -2
        - 2 - 14 + ? = 0 Cr = 6
- Displacement reaction:
    - A + BC = AC + B
- More active: stronger pull on other atoms' valence electrons
- Activity series for metals:
