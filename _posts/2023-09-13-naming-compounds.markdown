## Vocab
- Binary Ionic Compound: A compound composed of ions of two diff. elements,
                         one metal and one nonmetal.
- 

## Type 1: Binary Ionic Compounds
Type 1 Binary Compounds contain Group 1, 2, and 3 metals w/ nonmetal ions.
- Cation, or <i>paws</i>itively charged ion is named first, the anion,
  <i>a n</i>egatively charged ion, is named second.
- Monatomic (one-atom) cations take their name in the compound. 
    - For example, F<sup>+</sup> is fluorine in compounds.
- Monatomic anions are named by taking the root of the element and adding -ide.
    - For example, S<sup>2-</sup> ions are called sulfide (sulfur - ur + ide)

## Type 2: Binary Ionic Compounds
Type 2 Binary Compounds contain Transition metals and Group 3, 4, 5, 6 metals except for Aluminum with
nonmetal ions.
- Cations of transition metals named first, anions named second.
- Monatomic cations take their name from the atom + their charge
    - For example, Cu<sup>2+</sup> is Copper(II) and Cu<sup>+</sup> is called
      Copper(I)
- Transition metal cations except Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Cd<sup>2+</sup> and Ag<sup>+</sup> _must_ show their 
  oxidation numbers in parens when named in a compound with those ions.
    - Zinc, Cadmium, Silver
- The cations in groups in 3A-6A also have multiple charges even though they're not transition metals,
  so specify their positive charge in parens after their name.

## Type 3: Binary Covalent Compounds
Used for covalent compounds that only include non-metal elements.
- First element is named as element.
- Second element is named as ion name, prefixed with the number of atoms present in compound.
- The subscript is assumed to be 1 if not present. Do not subscript 1.

| number | prefix |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1      | mono   |
| 2      | di     |
| 3      | tri    |
| 4      | tetra  |
| 5      | penta  |
| 6      | hexa   |
| 7      | hepta  |
| 8      | octa   |
| 9      | nona   |
| 10     | deca   |

### Polyatomic Ions
AID trick:
-ate
-ite
-ide

Then, remember the oxygen levels.
Ex. Sulfur 4, 3:
- SO<sup>2-</sup><sub>4</sub>, SO<sup>2-</sup><sub>3</sub>
- Sulfate, Sulfite

## Class Notes
- Model lab tomorrow, need to draw 3d using field journaling techniques.
- Soldering proposal: Why should we be doing this lab? What's the benefit of our
  group doing it?

### Naming Compounds
- Do not mix these two types of rules.
- Binary Naming convention:
    - Nonpolar
    - 2 atoms: 1 willing to give electrons, one willing to accept electrons.
        - If both want to offer or both want to receive, then it won't work.
    - The anion always ends with -ide.
    - When you see ide, 
    - Metal: 1 oxidation number
    - Transition metal: 2 oxidation number
    - Use what you already know.
    - Metal (Nonmetal root)-ide. Cation (Anion root)-ide.
    - Multiple oxidation numbers: must declare.
        - Ex. Iron has 2, 3. Write iron(II) or iron(III).
        - If you have an iron(II) and want to bond an oxygen, need one 
          oxygen; iron(II) oxide, FeO.
        - If you have an iron(III) and want to bond oxygens, take common
          multiple, 6, so Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
        - nonmetal nonmetal howmany howmany
        - _see prefixes above_
