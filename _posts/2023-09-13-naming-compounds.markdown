## Vocab
- Binary Ionic Compound: A compound composed of ions of two diff. elements,
                         one metal and one nonmetal.
- 

## Type 1: Binary Ionic Compounds
- Cation, or <i>paws</i>itively charged ion is named first, the anion,
  <i>a n</i>egatively charged ion, is named second.
- Monatomic (one-atom) cations take their name in the compound. 
    - For example, F<sup>+</sup> is fluorine in compounds.
- Monatomic anions are named by taking the root of the element and adding -ide.
    - For example, S<sup>2-</sup> ions are called sulfide (sulfur - ur + ide)

## Type 2: Binary Ionic Compounds
- Cations of transition metals named first, anions named second.
- Monatomic cations take their name from the atom + their charge
    - For example, Cu<sup>2+</sup> is Copper(II) and Cu<sup>+</sup> is called
      Copper(I)
