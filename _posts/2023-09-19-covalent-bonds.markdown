## Vocab

## Covalent Bonds
- Nonmetal atoms _share_ their valence electrons. A neutral group of atoms held together via covalent bonds is 
  a molecule.
- Covalent bonds form when atoms get so close that their orbitals overlap.
    - The bond works because the electrons of the adjacent atoms repel each other, but their nuclei pull on the
      electrons, which holds the atoms together.
- Sometimes, atomic orbitals hybridize during covalent bonding, and this forms a new set of orbitals that make
  bonds in the molecule.
    - These bonds minimize the energy of the molecule and explains both the shape of molecules and how atoms
      share pairs of electrons.
    - An example of a hybridized orbital is the sp<sup>3</sup> orbital, which forms when an s and p orbital
      combine.

## Octet Rule
- To become stable, atoms of nonmetals form covalent bonds to achieve the electron configuration of a noble gas.
    - ex. A hydrogen atom needs 2 valence electrons to achieve the configuration of a noble gas (helium), so to
      become stable, two hydrogen atoms will share their valence electron, so that both atoms attain the noble
      gas config.
    - ex. Two fluorine atoms will share one electron, so that each atom has eight valence electrons.
    - Most other nonmetal atoms will share 1+ share electrons in order to get 8 electrons in their outer energy
      levels.
    - The number of shared valence electrons when atomic # > 1 is 8 - # of valence electrons.
- An electron dot structure shows how atoms share electrons to meet the octet rule, where a line may be used to
  show paired electrons, and dots used to show lone pairs, or atoms that are not paired up.
- Sometimes the octet rule doesn't work, such as in hydrogen, which'll have 2 valence electrons, and in boron,
  which might have six valence electrons.

## Types of Covalent Bonds
- Single Covalent Bond: atoms that only need one electron to get a noble gas electron configuration.
- Goes on for double and triple.
- Sharing more electrons increases the strength of the force of the bond.
    - ex. A double bond between carbon and oxygen is stronger than a single bond between carbon and oxygen.
- Coordinate Covalent Bond: in CO molecule (Carbon and Oxygen), the oxygen atom donates an extra pair of
  electrons to form a triple bond.
    - In a molec, it doesn't matter which atom the electrons in the bond come from. 

## VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion)
- Take number of lone pairs + number of shared electrons (The subscript for B + The subscript for E), count to 1
  in _s_, 3 in _p_, 5 in _d_, so on.
- Ex. AB<sub>2</sub>E<sub>2</sub>: 2 + 2 = 4; sp<sup>3</sup>
