## Vocab
- Octet Rule: Atoms tend to form bonds so that each atom has eight electrons in
  its valence/outer shell.

## Ions and the Octet Rule
- Atoms of noble gases have a full valence shell, so they are stable. 
- All noble gases have outer energy levels ns<sup>2</sup> np<sup>6</sup> except
  for Helium, which has an outer energy level 1s<sup>2</sup>.
    - Notice that these noble gases have eight valence electrons.
- Octet Rule
    - <i>see vocab above</i>
    - In most substances, atoms are arranged so that they have eight electrons
      in their outer shell, which makes them stable.
    - Hydrogen and Helium are examples of atoms that can be stable with 2 
      valence electrons.

## Class Notes

| Gems | Metals |
| --- | --- |
| Gems have defined shape, not bent. This means they were cut, not bent. | Metals have bends and joins, because they are plyable. |
| Gems are brittle, because they are nonmetal. | Metals will not shatter when banged on |

### Ionic Bond
- Bond formed between metal and nonmetal (according to the book)
- The book's reasoning for this is that when two atoms have very different 
  electronegativities, they are more likely to form an ionic bond.
    - When one atom is pulling hard on the other's valence electrons, the
      bond is much stronger. The valence electrons are 100% in the possesion of
      the atom w/ higher electronegativity. This is why ionic bonds, where one
      atom posesses the electrons 100% of the time, are stronger than covalent
      bonds which share.

### Drawing Electron Dot Structure
- Always take the place that is farthest away (left, right, top, bottom, left, 
  right, top, bottom)
- This is useful when showing bonds
    - Ex. Sodium has 1 valence electron, Chlorine has 7, Chlorine takes posession
      of that extra electron, forms an ionic bond.

### Other
- Coulomb's law can be used to show the strength of a bond.
    - Multiply the charges of the portions together, that magnitude is the 
      'strength' of the bond.
        - NaCl: Sodium has +1 charge, Chlorine has -1 charge.
        - MgO: Magnesium has +2 charge, Oxygen has -2 charge.

- Lattice energy is the energy required to break the lattice structure.
- Model lab next friday to construct shapes
- <b>Memorize Coulomb's law for the test!</b>

### Electron Flow
- Electrons flow from anion side to cation side. The anions on one side donate 
  their electrons to the cations on the other side.

### Prelab Corrections
- Prelab Q must be <i>before</i> the actual lab but <i>after</i> reading the 
  handouts. Must have these answered on prelab.
- Be specific in procedure about #4 and #9.
- No explanation needed on materials, separate equipment and consumables.
    - Equipment first, consumables last.
- Late work -5
- No numbering the sections! Numbering suggests continuity, 
- Nothing needs to be explained except the questions!
- Order of the sections

- If she tells you not to put the picture, then <i>don't</i> put the picture!
- Color means NOT WHITE!
- D was to retain test result individually for analysis, not just another test
  solution.
