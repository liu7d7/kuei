## Vocab
- Octet Rule: Atoms tend to form bonds so that each atom has eight electrons in
  its valence/outer shell.

## Ions and the Octet Rule
- Atoms of noble gases have a full valence shell, so they are stable. 
- All noble gases have outer energy levels ns<sup>2</sup> np<sup>6</sup> except
  for Helium, which has an outer energy level 1s<sup>2</sup>.
    - Notice that these noble gases have eight valence electrons.
- Octet Rule
    - <i>see vocab above</i>
    - In most substances, atoms are arranged so that they have eight electrons
      in their outer shell, which makes them stable.
    - Hydrogen and Helium are examples of atoms that can be stable with 2 
      valence electrons.
- Atoms generally lose or gain electrons to make their valence shells contain
  eight electrons. Elements in groups 1 and 2 lose an electron to get an octet,
  and elements in groups 15-17 tend to gain electrons to get an octet.
    - <i>see the table below for ion charges by group</i>

### Ion Charges By Group

| 1A | 2A | 3A | 4A | 5A | 6A | 7A | 8A |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1<sup>+</sup> | 2<sup>+</sup> | 3<sup>+</sup> | 4+/4<sup>-</sup> | 3<sup>-</sup> | 2<sup>-</sup> | 1<sup>-</sup> | 0 |

<i>Note how the atom always takes the shortest path to an octet</i>

## Ionic Bonds
- Ionic bonds occur when two elements that are equally charged but with opposing
  signs react, producing an electrically neutral compound, or an ionic compound.
- Ionic bonds must occur between two elements whose electronegativities differ
  greatly (by more than 1.7, see table in Modern Chem p 176).
    - This means one of the atoms in the bond takes posession of the valence
      electrons of the other, so that they belong to one for nearly 100% of the
      time.

## Steps to Form an Ionic Bond
This is an example between lithium and chlorine.
1. Li has 1 valence electron, and Cl has 7. Since Li prefers to lose an electron
   and Cl prefers to gain electrons, the valence electron of the lithium atom
   transfers to the chlorine atom.
2. We now have a lithium cation and a chlorine anion, with charges 1<sup>+</sup>
   and 1<sup>-</sup>, respectively.
3. The charges between the two atoms are now balanced, so they form an
   electrically balanced compound. Our ionic compound is finished.

## Crystal Lattices
- Solids made out of atoms bonded with ionic bonds are actually laid out as a
  crystal lattice, or an orderly, repeating, 3d pattern of lots of ions, atoms,
  or molecules.

## Using Coulomb's Law to Find Bond Strength
- Use 9.0Ã—10<sup>9</sup> nm<sup>2</sup>/C<sup>2</sup> as <i>k<sub>e</sub></i>
- Plug that into <i>k</i><sub>e</sub> * <i>q</i><sub>1</sub> * <i>q</i><sub>2</sub> / <i>d</i><sup>2</sup>

## Class Notes

| Gems | Metals |
| --- | --- |
| Gems have defined shape, not bent. This means they were cut, not bent. | Metals have bends and joins, because they are plyable. |
| Gems are brittle, because they are nonmetal. | Metals will not shatter when banged on |

### Ionic Bond
- Bond formed between metal and nonmetal (according to the book)
- The book's reasoning for this is that when two atoms have very different 
  electronegativities, they are more likely to form an ionic bond.
    - When one atom is pulling hard on the other's valence electrons, the
      bond is much stronger. The valence electrons are 100% in the possesion of
      the atom w/ higher electronegativity. This is why ionic bonds, where one
      atom posesses the electrons 100% of the time, are stronger than covalent
      bonds which share.

### Drawing Electron Dot Structure
- Always take the place that is farthest away (left, right, top, bottom, left, 
  right, top, bottom)
- This is useful when showing bonds
    - Ex. Sodium has 1 valence electron, Chlorine has 7, Chlorine takes posession
      of that extra electron, forms an ionic bond.

### Other
- Coulomb's law can be used to show the strength of a bond.
    - Multiply the charges of the portions together, that magnitude is the 
      'strength' of the bond.
        - NaCl: Sodium has +1 charge, Chlorine has -1 charge.
        - MgO: Magnesium has +2 charge, Oxygen has -2 charge.

- Lattice energy is the energy required to break the lattice structure.
- Model lab next friday to construct shapes
- <b>Memorize Coulomb's law for the test!</b>

### Electron Flow
- Electrons flow from anion side to cation side. The anions on one side donate 
  their electrons to the cations on the other side.

### Prelab Corrections
- Prelab Q must be <i>before</i> the actual lab but <i>after</i> reading the 
  handouts. Must have these answered on prelab.
- Be specific in procedure about #4 and #9.
- No explanation needed on materials, separate equipment and consumables.
    - Equipment first, consumables last.
- Late work -5
- No numbering the sections! Numbering suggests continuity, 
- Nothing needs to be explained except the questions!
- Order of the sections
    1. Title
    2. Purpose
    3. Background
    4. Hypothesis
    5. Prelab Questions
    6. Materials
    7. Procedure

    9. Result
    10. 4Q.
- If she tells you not to put the picture, then <i>don't</i> put the picture!
- Color means NOT WHITE!
- D was to retain test result individually for analysis, not just another test
  solution.
