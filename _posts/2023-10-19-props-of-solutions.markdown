## Vocab
Dissolution rate: the rate at which a solute dissolves.
Solubility: amount of solute that dissolves in a given quantity of a solvent @ a specific T/P to produce a saturated solution.
Solvation: the process of dissolution, where water molecules remove solute ions from the crystal. Dissolved ions return to the crystal @ the same time.
Saturation: equilibrium between solvating and crystallizing solute.
Types of solutions:
    - Saturated: contains maximum amount of solute at that specific T/P.
    - Unsaturated: "  minimum  "
    - Supersaturated:
Hypoxic Zones: areas in the ocean where the oxygen concentration is so low that animal life suffocates.
    - Caused by the downward sloping solubility line of oxygen.

## Solubility Curve
Y axis: solubility (g/100g H<sub>2</sub>O), X axis: temperature.
- Solubility curve = Saturation line. If a solution is on that line (amount of solute dissolved @ that temperature is on that line), we've got a saturated solution.
- Special cases: most times, the solubility line has a slope of >= 0. However, some substances that are exothermic when dissolved such as Yb<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> and gases have a downward sloping solubility curve/line.
    - Why does Ytterbium Sulfate have a downward sloping solubility line? Dissolution for that compound is an exothermic process, which means there needs to be somewhere for the heat to go when dissolving. However, if the temperature of the solvent is already high, then there's nowhere for the heat to go, inhibiting dissolution.
    - Gases: the higher temperature further increases the already high kinetic energy of the gas, and it escapes the solution.

## Supersaturation
A supersaturated solution contains more solute than can be normally held in the solvent at a given temperature. These crystallize after a seed crystal of solute is added, with more ions of solute settling on the seed crystal than are plucked off by the water molecules.

## Henry's Law
States that @ the same temperature, solubility and pressure are directly proportional. If you have two bits of gas at the same temperature but at different pressures, the ratio between their solubilities will be equal to the ratio between their pressures.

S<sub>1</sub>/P<sub>1</sub> = S<sub>2</sub>/P<sub>2</sub>

How do we prevent an opened bottle of soft drink from losing its carbonation?
- Put it in a pressure vessel to increase pressure (in order to keep the pressure above the liquid and the pressure of the bubbles of CO<sub>2</sub> rising up in equilibrium).
- Decrease temperature (gases have a higher solubility at lower temperatures)
