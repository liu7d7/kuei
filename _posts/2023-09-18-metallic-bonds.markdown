## Vocab
- Sea of electrons: the valence electrons of diff ions are shared, so that the
  ions can move freely throughout the metallic substance.
- Malleable: able to be shaped without shattering, one of the key
  traits of metallic substances.
- Ductile: able to be pulled into thin wires.
- Brittle: easily shatters.

## Boiling/Melting Points
- Most metals have high melting points, but it all depends on how strong the
  bonds between the ions are. A stronger bond will have a higher melting point
  because it takes more energy to break the bond.
    - ex. Sodium will have a lower melting point than magnesium because it has
      a 1+ charge, which is not as strong as magnesium's 2+ charge. As a result,
      the bonds between magnesium ions should be about 4x as strong.
