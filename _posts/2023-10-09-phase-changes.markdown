## Vocab
- Phase Change:

## Class Notes
- How to read graphs:
    1. Identify axes. 
    2. Draw a line parallel to one of the axes to compare >1 line on the graph. 
- Solid -> Liquid: Melting
- Liquid -> Gas: Vaporization
- Gas -> Solid: Deposition
- Solid -> Gas: Sublimation
- Liquid -> Solid: Freezing
- Gas -> Liquid: Condensation
- Claim-Evidence-Reasoning
    - C: Recall
    - E: Evidence - things that you _sense_, like water, heat, condensation, steam, NOT exact measured stuff
      like temperature.
    - R: 
- Lower Vapor Pressure = Lower Boiling Point
- Phase Diagrams: Y axis = Pressure (atm), X axis = Temperature (&deg;C).
- All molecs _other than water_ have a positive sloping melting line.
- Lines on a phase diagram are the melting line, vaporisation line, and sublimation lines. The reason it's a
  line, not a point, is that that value changes @ diff pressures.  
- On Kuei's graph: CA -> constant line btw. S -> L, AB -> dot colinear w/ CA line on liquid -> gas, BD -> line 
  colinear w/ CA in solid.
