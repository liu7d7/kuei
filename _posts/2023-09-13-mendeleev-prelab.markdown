## Prelab

### Title
- Mendeleev Lab

### Purpose
- We are going to try to group elements by chemical properties and
  observations, like Mendeleev did to make his periodic table.

### Background
- Mendeleev's periodic table was arranged by increasing atomic mass and
  observations, as well as future predictions of elements. Mendeleev took 
  findings from Newland's octaves and Dobereiner's triads, combined them 
  with his discoveries, and created his table.

### Hypothesis
- I think we can group the elements according to their chemical behavior by 
  testing how they react when put in various substances and grouping the 
  elements that produce similar results together.

### Materials
- Chemical Splash Goggles
- Apron
- Reaction Plates
- Stirring pins
- unknown elements 1-9
- four test solutions A, B, C, D

### Questions
- How does Mendeleev’s periodic table differ from the modern periodic table?
    - Mendeleev’s table is different because it is sorted by atomic mass 
      instead of atomic number. Though it is sorted by atomic mass,
      Mendeleev noticed some anomalies with that sorting method and ended 
      up fixing them, which ended up sorting the table by atomic number.

- Why did Mendeleev leave blank spaces on his periodic table?
    - Mendeleev left blank spaces on his periodic table because he predicted
      future discovered elements would take those spots, and later 
      discoveries ended up justifying his predictions.

- Why is it necessary to mix solutions that don't show an immediate change?
    - To make the solution show a change faster or increase the speed of the
      reaction by making the solution homogeneous and having the parts of 
      the mixture be thoroughly mixed together.

- Why do we need to rinse the test tubes between trials?
    - We must rinse each test tube thoroughly between trials to avoid
      contamination. 

- Which solutions do we need to dispose of in separate containers?
    - Solutions that react with each other need to be disposed of in a 
      separate container.

### Data Table

## Procedure
1. Put on the proper Personal Protective Equipment, including goggles and 
   lab aprons. Prepare 36 testing wells by cleaning them of dust, removing 
   all contaminants, and labeling the wells with a piece of paper. After, 
   take a picture of the wells.
2. Label the thirteen pipettes 1-9 and A-D, so as to avoid contamination.
   Each pipette is used for one solution.
3. For each unknown 1-9.
    1. Add 1-2 drops of solution A to the unknown.
    2. Add 1-2 drops of solution B to the unknown, in a separate well.
    3. Add 1-2 drops of solution C to the unknown, in a separate well.
    4. Add 1-2 drops of solution D to the unknown, in a separate well.
    5. Stir test wells that don't show a reaction for ten seconds.
    6. Make sure to rinse off the stir rod to avoid contamination.
4. Record all results in the data table.
5. Dispose of the waste materials from testing solutions 4 and 9 into the 
   separate labeled containers given by your instructor. These solutions
   are toxic.
6. Clean up the work area, and wash your hands to avoid bringing any
   hazardous materials outside the lab environment.

## Class Notes

### Flash News

  have developed a new way of farming that allows for increasing the range of
  precision sensors by a factor of three, helping farmers farm better.

### Other
- Improve hand-eye coordination
