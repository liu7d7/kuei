## Kinetic Theory and a Model for Gases
- Energy an object has due to motion is called _kinetic energy_. 
- _Kinetic theory_ is a model scientists use to describe all matter as tiny particles in constant motion.

## Common Gases
- The particles in a gas can be individual atoms, diatomic molecs, or more complex molecs.
- _STP (standard temperature and pressure)_ is a standard set of conditions used for comparing properties of 
  diff gases and corresponds to a temp of 0&deg;C & atomospheric pressure @ sea level (100kPa).
- Gases at STP: H, He, N, O, F, Cl, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn, Og
- Liquids at STP: Br, Hg

## Gas Pressure
- Temperature Up: Pressure Up
- Volume Up: Pressure Down
- \# Particles Up: Pressure Up
- _Gas pressure_ is the result of forces between molecs of gas and the walls of the enclosing container.
    - Gas pressure results from collision forces between molecules, and more force can result from shrinking 
      the container, adding more particles, or speeding up the particles.
        - Higher temperature -> particles move faster, increasing likelihood & force of collisions, pressure is
          higher.
        - More particles -> likelihood of collisions goes up, increasing pressure.
- Units of pressure: _PSI_ = pounds per square inch, _kPa_ = kilopascal = newton per square meter, _mm Hg_ =
  millimeters of mercury.
- 1 _atm_, 101.3 _kPa_, 760 _mm Hg_, 14.7 _PSI_
- A _mercury barometer_ measures the pressure of the air pushing down on the mercury, which forces the air up 
  the tube.

## Kinetic Energy and Particle Motion
- _Translation_: shift from one point in space to another
- _Rotation_: body spins around a point
- _Vibration_: object moves rapidly back and forth but stays in a fixed place.
- Gas: free to move in _all three ways_.
- Liquid: close proximity & attractions between particles _limit translational motion_.
- Solid: the particles are close together & are strongly attracted to each other, so _translation and rotation 
  are completely removed_. Only vibration can occur.

## Liquids and Intermolecular Forces
- Substances that flow are considered a fluid.
- Both liquids and gases are fluids because they conform to the shape of a container.
- 

## Class Notes
- Flash News: Researchers @ Cornell have created a new robot that is insect-sized and can perform search 
  operations that will be combustion-powered and un-tethered.
- STP for academia usually 0&deg;C, 1 atm.
- Amorphous solids do not have a crystal structure, so they won't fracture into a definite shape.
- At a higher altitude, will it take longer or shorter to cook, will the water boil at a higher or cooler
  temperature?
    - At a higher altitude, it will take longer to cook or not get cooked at all because boiling point is at a 
      lower temperature. You _need_ pressure to cook.
